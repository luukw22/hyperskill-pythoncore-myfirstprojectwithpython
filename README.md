# Hyperskill Python Core: My First Project with Python project
This project will introduce you to Hyperskill projects. Practice Python coding to build a program that can automate your account management routine.

## About
Imagine that you're the owner of a new small corner shop. You are doing well and want to determine how much you earned in the first month. Create a simple tool that will calculate your net income. Upon completing this project, you can use this tool for your own accounting needs.

## Training project
This project allows you to practice and strengthen your coding skills, helping you get ready for more advanced tasks ahead.
